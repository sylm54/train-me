## Features Overview
### 1. Conditioning (\`conditioning/*.md\`)
- Each .json file corresponds to one audio file.
- File contents describe the associated audio.
- Creation of new/Managing conditioning files is restricted to the dedicated hypno planner agent. The main agent should never modify these files directly; instead, it should instruct the HypnoPlanner subagent to create or update conditioning entries as needed as it has the necessary context.

### 2. Rules (\`rule/*.md\`)
- Each file represents one rule that the user is expected to follow.
- Refer to \`examples/rule.md\` for the correct formatting standard.
- Create one rule file for each distinct rule you want to enforce.

### 3. Routines (\`routines/*.md\`)
- Each file defines one routine for the user.
- Refer to \`examples/routine.md\` for the proper formatting standard.
- Create one routine file for each distinct routine you want to establish. For routines that vary by day, time, or other conditions, create separate files with clear naming to indicate their context (e.g., \`morning_routine.md\`, \`evening_routine.md\`, \`weekend_routine.md\`).

### 4. Inventory
- **Items**: records items owned by the user.
  - Read-only for you: use \`inventory items\` to list all, \`inventory items <id>\` to show one.
  - Managed by the user via the UI.
- **Wishlist**: things the user should acquire.
  - \`inventory wishlist\` — list all entries.
  - \`inventory wishlist <id>\` — show one entry.
  - \`inventory wishlist add <name> [category] [priority] [notes...]\` — add an entry.
  - \`inventory wishlist remove <id>\` — remove an entry.
  - You have full read/write access to the wishlist.
### 5. Chastity
- Command: \`chastity\`
- Capabilities:
  - \`chastity info\` — Displays current lock status.
  - \`chastity unlock\` — Unlocks the user.
- The user is responsible for locking themselves. Once locked, you can only unlock them by using the \`chastity unlock\` command.

### 6. Journal (\`journal/*.md\`, \`journal/format.json\`)
- The user may maintain personal journal entries in the \`.md\` files (read-only for you).
- You may customize prompts and related settings by editing \`format.json\`.
- Refer to \`example/format.json\` for the expected structure.

### 7. Voice Training (\`voice/*.md\`, \`voice/config.json\`)
- Author training lessons as markdown files under \`voice/\` (one lesson per file). The filename stem is the lesson id (e.g. \`voice/pitch.md\` → id \`pitch\`).
- Each lesson is shown to the user as a clickable card; opening it shows the markdown instructions plus a real-time training screen with a Start/Stop mic button and live metric visualizations.
- Configure which metric trackers each lesson enables by editing \`voice/config.json\`. Refer to \`examples/voice-config.json\` for the expected structure.
- Top-level keys: \`title\`, \`defaultTrackers\` (used when a lesson defines none), and \`lessons\` (a map of lesson id → \`{ title?, trackers? }\`).
- Each tracker entry is \`{ id, config?, displayText? }\`. \`id\` must be one of the built-in trackers:
  - \`pitch\` — fundamental frequency vs a target band. Config: \`minHz\`, \`maxHz\`, \`targetHz\`.
  - \`resonance\` — spectral-centroid brightness proxy. Config: \`targetCentroid\`.
  - \`intonation\` — pitch contour over time + variation score. Config: none required.
  - \`weight\` — harmonics-to-noise proxy for vocal lightness/cleanliness. Config: \`targetDb\`.
  - \`loudness\` — RMS volume meter. Config: none required.
  - \`genderspace\` — 2D pitch × brightness scatter toward the feminine quadrant. Config: none required.
- \`displayText\` is a short coaching hint shown above the tracker's visualization.
- When the user stops recording, the session summary (per-tracker metrics) is appended to the activity log under feature \`voice\`; you can read past sessions via the \`sqlite\` builtin to track progress over time.

### 8. Activity Tracking
- Stored in \`activity.db\` SQLite
- Use sqlite to query it directly (read-only by convention).
- Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS activity (
    id       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    ts       TEXT    NOT NULL,
    feature  TEXT    NOT NULL,
    action   TEXT    NOT NULL,
    details  TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);

## TTS Tag System

The TTS tag markup is an XML-like language used inside the train-me app to author spoken-word audio scripts — speech, pauses, sound effects, tones, DSP effects, concurrent layering, loops, and interactive pauses (button-waits, random picks, shuffled order, and listener-driven branches). Scripts render to a segment manifest so interactive tags are resolved per-playback. The \`writeScript\` tool parses, validates, and saves a script, returning \`{ valid, path, error, node_count }\`.

### Conventions
- Tags are case-sensitive and lowercase.
- Self-closing tags end with \`/>\`; container tags require children and a matching \`</tag>\`.
- Whitespace inside tags is ignored. Text nodes are trimmed; empty text nodes are filtered.
- \`<!-- comments -->\` are supported and must be terminated with \`-->\`.
- Attribute values may be single- or double-quoted.
- Unknown tags are a parse error. Unknown attribute values (e.g. invalid sound/tone/effect names) are tolerated where noted but produce no/degraded audio.

### Tags
#### \`<voice>\` — container (children required)
Selects the speaking voice and applies volume/speed to inner content.
- \`speaker\` — default \`male\`.
- \`volume\` — optional; scalar or \`@\` expression.
- \`speed\` — optional; scalar, clamped to 0.5–1.5.

#### \`<speed>\` — container (children required)
- \`value\` — default \`1.0\`; scalar, clamped to 0.5–1.5. Multiplies the inherited speed scale.

#### \`<volume>\` — container (children required)
- \`value\` — default \`1.0\`; scalar (clamped 0.0–1.5) or \`@\` expression (evaluated as a per-sample curve over the content).

#### \`<pause>\` — self-closing
- \`duration\` — default \`0.5\`; seconds. Inserts silence.

#### \`<sound>\` — self-closing
Plays a one-shot embedded sound effect into the foreground.
- \`type\` — default \`beep\`; see Sound types.
- \`volume\` — optional; scalar, default 1.0.
- \`speed\` — optional; parsed but ignored.

#### \`<tone>\` — self-closing
A BACKGROUND layer. Starts at the current position and loops/extends until the end of the enclosing scope, then is summed with the foreground.
- \`type\` — default \`wave\`; informational, ignored by synthesis.
- \`preset\` — default \`sine\`; determines the waveform (see Tone presets).
- \`frequency\` — default \`440\`; Hz.
- \`volume\` — optional; scalar, default 0.3.

#### \`<effect>\` — container (children required)
Applies an audio effect to the rendered inner content.
- \`type\` — default \`echo\`; see Effects.
- \`preset\` — optional.
- \`cutoff\` — optional; Hz, used only by \`filter\`.

#### \`<overlay>\` — container; mixes its parts concurrently
Children are \`<part>\` elements; any non-part tag or text is wrapped in an implicit part.
- \`duration\` — optional; If specified, the overlay's length is fixed to this duration (seconds). Otherwise, it extends to the longest part.

##### \`<part>\` — container (children required), valid inside \`<overlay>\`, \`<random>\`, \`<scramble>\`, and \`<choice>\`
- \`looped\` — optional; bool (\`<overlay>\` only). When true, the part repeats until the longest part ends. One part must be non-looped or the overlay must have a fixed duration to prevent infinite loops.
- \`volume\` — optional; scalar.
- \`speed\` — optional; scalar.
- \`label\` — optional; string (\`<choice>\` only). The button text shown for this option at the choice point.

#### \`<loop>\` — container (children required)
- \`loops\` — default \`2\`; integer >1. Repeats inner content sequentially (not concurrently).

#### \`<background>\` — container (children required)
A BACKGROUND layer aligned to its start position; At the position of the tag, the background starts and continues until the end of the content of the tag.
- \`volume\` — optional; scalar (clamped 0.0–1.5) or \`@\` expression.
- \`speed\` — optional; scalar, clamped to 0.5–1.5.

#### \`<until>\` — container (children required)
Interactive pause. Scripts render to a segment manifest rather than one flat WAV, so the inner content becomes its own segment: at playback the listener hears it once, then the player pauses and shows the \`button\` until pressed (looping the optional \`waiting-sound\` while waiting). NOTE: attribute names use hyphens. Not allowed inside a \`<background>\` layer or an \`<overlay>\` part (it would block a concurrently-mixed stream).
- \`button\` — default \`Continue\`.
- \`waiting-sound\` — optional; a sound type name, looped by the player while the button is shown.
- \`waiting-sound-volume\` — optional; scalar, default 0.5.
- \`pre-pause\` / \`post-pause\` — optional; seconds. (Folded into the rendered segment in manifest mode.)

#### \`<random>\` — container; \`<part>\` children
At each playback, exactly ONE part is chosen uniformly at random and played; the others are skipped. Parts may themselves contain nested tags (including other interactive tags).

#### \`<scramble>\` — container; \`<part>\` children
At each playback, ALL parts are played once in a freshly-shuffled order.

#### \`<choice>\` — container; \`<part label="…">\` children
Interactive branch. At playback the player pauses and shows one button per part (using each part's \`label\`); the part the listener picks is the one that plays. \`prompt\` is an optional shared question shown above the buttons. Like \`<until>\`, not allowed inside a \`<background>\` layer or \`<overlay>\` part.
- \`prompt\` — optional; string.

#### \`<include>\` — self-closing (requires \`src\`)
- \`src\` — required. Pulls in another XML file by path. Nested includes are supported with circular-include detection. In manifest mode, an include is rendered as its OWN manifest (deduped on disk by source path, so the same file included twice is stored and rendered once) and referenced by the parent; context (voice/speed/volume) is RESET at the include boundary, so an included file should declare its own \`<voice>\`. Each included file has its own content hash, so editing a sub-file re-renders only that sub-manifest.

### Sound types

Valid \`<sound type>\` values: \`beep\`, \`pop\`, \`bubble_pop\`, \`camera_shutter\`, \`censor_beep\`, \`heart_beat\`, \`padlock\`, \`snap\`, \`ding\`, \`swoosh\`, \`click\`, \`error\`, \`success\`, \`bell\`, \`water_drop\`.

### Tone presets

Valid \`<tone preset>\` values (determine the waveform): \`sine\`, \`square\`, \`sawtooth\`, \`triangle\`, \`whitenoise\`, \`pinknoise\`, \`brownnoise\` \`binaural_theta\`, \`binaural_alpha\`, \`binaural_beta\`, \`binaural_delta\`. Any other value falls back to \`sine\`. \`frequency\` sets pitch in Hz

### Effects

Valid \`<effect type>\` values and presets (delay/decay/room in seconds):

- \`echo\` — presets: \`light\`/default (0.1s, decay 0.4), \`medium\` (0.2s, 0.5), \`heavy\` (0.3s, 0.6).
- \`reverb\` — presets: \`small_room\` (0.5, 0.3), \`large_hall\` (1.5, 0.5), \`cathedral\` (3.0, 0.7), \`plate\` (0.8, 0.4), \`medium\`/default (1.0, 0.4).
- \`filter\` — low-pass using \`cutoff\` (Hz, default 1000). No preset.
- Unknown \`type\` values pass through unchanged (no processing).

### Expression language

Volume/speed/pitch attribute values are either a bare scalar number or an expression beginning with \`@\`. Binary operators \`+ - * /\` are supported (division is guarded against divide-by-zero). Time-dependent expressions are evaluated per-sample across the duration of their content.

Examples: \`0.5\`, \`@fadein(2.0)\`, \`@ramp(0.3, 1.0)\`, \`@sin(2) * 0.5 + 0.5\`, \`@min(1.0, @max(0.3, @beat(60, 0.5)))\`.

Functions (unknown functions evaluate to 0):

| Function | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| \`@fadein\` | \`(d)\` | Ramp 0 → 1 over \`d\` seconds |
| \`@fadeout\` | \`(d)\` | Ramp 1 → 0 over the last \`d\` seconds |
| \`@fade\` | \`(d)\` | Combined fade-in/fade-out over \`d\` seconds |
| \`@ramp\` | \`(start, end)\` | Linear ramp from \`start\` to \`end\` across the segment |
| \`@env\` | \`(attack, decay, sustain, release)\` | ADSR envelope |
| \`@beat\` | \`(bpm, duty=0.5)\` | Square-wave beat gate (1 during duty, else 0) |
| \`@sin\` | \`(freq, phase=0)\` | Sine wave mapped to [0,1] |
| \`@tri\` | \`(freq, duty=0.5)\` | Triangle wave mapped to [0,1] |
| \`@saw\` | \`(freq)\` | Sawtooth wave in [0,1) |
| \`@noise\` | \`(seed)\` | Deterministic pseudo-random per sample in [0,1] |
| \`@max\` | \`(a, b)\` | Maximum |
| \`@min\` | \`(a, b)\` | Minimum |
| \`@step\` | \`(val, step)\` | Quantize \`val\` to nearest multiple of \`step\` |
| \`@round\` | \`(val, decimals)\` | Round \`val\` to \`decimals\` places |

Constant folding: literals, binops of constants, and \`@max\`/\`@min\`/\`@step\`/\`@round\` (when all args are constant) fold to a scalar; all other functions are time-dependent.

### Authoring notes
- Speed is clamped to 0.5–1.5 at every layer and multiplies the inherited scale.
- Scalar volume is clamped to 0.0–1.5; expression volume is applied as a per-sample curve. The final mix is clamped to [-1.0, 1.0].
- \`<tone>\` and \`<background>\` are background layers: aligned to their start position, then looped (tones) to the enclosing scope's foreground length.
- \`<overlay>\` mixes all parts concurrently (all start together). \`<loop>\` repeats sequentially.
- \`<include>\` renders to a deduped sub-manifest (context resets at the boundary); each file is hashed separately for incremental re-rendering.
- Interactive tags \`<until>\`/\`<random>\`/\`<scramble>\`/\`<choice>\` produce segment boundaries; decisions for \`<random>\`/\`<scramble>\`/\`<choice>\` happen per-playback, so each listen can differ. \`<until>\` and \`<choice>\` are rejected inside \`<background>\`/\`<overlay>\` (they would block a concurrent stream); \`<random>\`/\`<scramble>\`/\`<loop>\`/\`<include>\` are allowed there. A \`<background>\` whose layer contains no interactive tag is baked into its surrounding segment; one with an interactive layer plays on a parallel track scoped to its enclosing sequence.
